# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

• I intentionally use huge clunky variable names throughout this repo. While algorithm textbooks lean toward i, j, k, m, n, partition q etc...descriptive variable names helped me keep track of all the moving parts when I was learning these. Maybe it'll help someone else one day.

• I'm still learning and will re-factor and improve on these when I can. Right now, I just want to get something up to give an idea of my progress over the last several months since exiting the military.

## Backgroud

JavaScript was the first programming language I learned. I didn't have a choice as it's the only one I had access to. I taught myself JavaScript on a submarine submerged under the ocean using a secret government laptop, a browser and a book, with no internet. They wouldn't let me install Node on the server while in port, let alone some fancy IDE or compiler. It took me several days to solve the FizzBuzz problem, alone, with no one to turn to for help. I had no sense of algorithmic complexity or efficiency and I was just ecstatic to see my nested for loops working in the IE console.

Having learned C#, transcompiling all this code back into JS was a real joy. It's always shorter in JS and clicks in my head a little better. While I understand the advantages of type safety and big frameworks, vanilla JavaScript still feels like home.
