# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

• This repo contains implementations of data structures and algorithms written in JS.

• I intentionally use huge clunky variable names throughout this repo. While algorithm textbooks lean toward i, j, k, m, n, partition q etc...descriptive variable names help me to keep track of all the moving parts.

• I'm still finalizing this repo and will continue to refactor and add to it. Right now, I just want to get something up to give an idea of progress made over the last several months since separating from the military.

## Backgroud

JavaScript was the first programming language I learned. I taught myself in my spare time, while deployed on a submarine, submerged under the ocean using a laptop, a browser and a book, with no internet. Due to protocols, I couldn't install Node, let alone an IDE or compiler. I had no sense of algorithmic complexity or efficiency and was just happy to see my nested for loops printing to an IE console.

### I <3 JS

Having learned C#, transcompiling all this back into JS was a real joy. It's usually shorter in JS and clicks in my head a little better. While I understand the advantages of type safety and big frameworks, vanilla JavaScript still feels like home.
